== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= This always seems to error out on me! =

The ClearRead API can be fickle at times. If there is an error, the response message gives you clear instructions on how to fix it.

= Can I add more than one post at a time? =

Currently, no. I plan on adding this feature at some point.

= Isn't this stealing? =

This was built to handle those very difficult migrations from older CMS systems (or static HTML sites). This was NOT meant to enable wholesale theft of content.

= But could I steal with this? =

Don't be that guy.

== Screenshots ==
